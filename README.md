# ROS Industrial - Simple Motion Control

## Requirements:

**Software:**
```bash
Robot Operating System (ROS) - Tested on Melodic distribution
```

ROS: https://www.ros.org

## Project Description:

Simple demonstration of robot motion control and trajectory planning via the ROS system using several simulation tools (RVIZ, gazebo, etc.)

Controlling the movement of multiple industrial robots (ABB, Fanuc, Universal Robots, etc.) using the Python programming language (catkin, rospy, launch file, etc.)

Main challenges of project implementation:
- text

The project was created to improve the [VRM (Programming for Robots and Manipulators)](https://github.com/rparak/Programming-for-robots-and-manipulators-VRM) university course.

The project was realized at Institute of Automation and Computer Science, Brno University of Technology, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (NETME Centre - Cybernetics and Robotics Division)
